# AI_Experiments
Test and experiment some of the wonderful ML/DL use cases

1. Invisibility Cloak - using Color Detection and Segmentation with OpenCV
2. Age Gender and Emotion Detection - using OpenCV Keras and Transfer Learning
3. Face Mask Detection using OpenCV and CNN
4. Python code compilation to generate Christmas tree, star and greetings using turtle library and pattern printing
5. AI Sketching - This is demo code to sketch yourself live using OpenCV library. It uses your webcam to capture your image and then sketch you
6. Neural Style Transfer (NST) - Transfer image/video style from one to another using CNN and OpenCV
7. Predicting Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of a machinery
